# PHP API Call
This project was made just to test my PHP skills and abilities. This project is made to address the rate limiting issue of an API by storing the contents in a database.

# The Goal
I want to learn different, more efficient ways to code. Eventually as I get better, I would like to return to this project and optimize the code for better maintenance in the future. Eventually I might be able to get this to a plugin that people could use.

# Features
- Create Database if there isn't one already
- Calls to an API if there is a new day or if current day is null
- Sorts through JSON String and returns items
- Returns items and stores them within a database by category
- Creates multiple post types for each category
- Gets items from database and uses them as an output for different post based on category type
